# Black Hat Python Presentation

This is for a presentation to the Edmonton Python User Group.

There are a few docker files here that can be helpful:

* bhp - Sets up a python environment with sqlmap, scapy, and more
* drupal - Sets up a vulnerable 7.31 version of drupal
* webgoat - Creates a docker image with WebGoat 6.0.1 all ready to go. For this you will have to download the WebGoat jar file and place it in the dockerfiles/webgoat/files directory and then build the docker file.
